When are two program executions similar?  In most contexts, the answer is that they are similar when they satisfy or violate correctness properties for the same reasons.  This paper proposes a novel metric for measuring the distance between two failing test cases, and automated debugging methods based on that metric.  The metric is based on a causal concept of distance:  executions are similar to the degree that changes in the program itself, called mutants, cause similar changes in the correctness of the executions.  Specifically, if two failing test cases become successful due to the same mutant, they are more likely to be due to the same fault.  We evaluate the mutant-based distance metric by applying it to problems of fault identification and automated debugging assistance for two widely-used real-world compilers, and demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art methods.
