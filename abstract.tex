Measuring the distance between two program executions is a fundamental problem in dynamic analysis of software, and useful in many test generation and debugging algorithms.  This paper proposes a novel metric for measuring distance between executions, and specializes it to the most common application, determining similarity of failing test cases.  The metric is based on a causal concept of distance: executions are similar to the degree that changes in the program itself, introduced using mutation operators, cause similar changes in the correctness of the executions.  Specifically, if two failing test cases (for the original program) become successful due to the same mutant, they are more likely to be due to the same fault.  We evaluate our metric using more than 50 faults and 2,800 test cases for two widely-used real-world compilers, and demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art methods for fault identification and localization.
